I bought my first camera because I wanted to better document the abandoned places I was exploring, and that’s how Abandoned Upstate began. It also became my first
foray into podcasting, sharing the sounds and stories of forgotten spaces before I ever stepped in to help others tell theirs. Since then it’s grown into a mix of photos,
video, and research that preserves the history, architecture, and quiet beauty of decay.

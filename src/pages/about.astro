    I'm Bryant Neal, a content creator based in Rochester, New York. I'm into film, filming, filming on film, and just about anything you can do with a camera. Day to day, I make wedding films on Super 8, camcorders, and modern 4K digital. I started out with photography, and while video is now my main focus, I still take on photography projects for events, portraits, and real estate.

    When it comes to film itself, I'm all about scanning and digitizing old formats. I convert VHS to digital, restore family films, and even create new projects on vintage gear. I still keep things a little old school too, listening to music on iPods and sending emails from a computer. Otherwise, you can usually find me preserving history while documenting decay.

    I regularly team up with my partner in crime, Jessica from Nightfox Films. Together, we’ve tackled everything from social media management to podcast production, and we’re always looking for new ways to mix things up. Lately, I’ve been especially into using vintage formats, like VHS or Super 8 film. I’d love to see it as a part of modern branding. It could be a fun way to stand out!
